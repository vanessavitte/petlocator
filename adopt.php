			<img src="images/adopt.png"/>
			
			<p>Shelters large and small always have a great selection of animals looking for new homes, from cats and dogs to birds and small animals, to horses and livestock. In fact, any type of animal available for sale at your local pet store or breeder is probably waiting for adoption in a nearby shelter.</p>

			<h4>Why a shelter or rescue group?</h4>
 
			<ul>
				 <li>6&#45;8 million pets end up in shelters each year; half of those will probably not be adopted.</li>
				<li>25 percent of pets in shelters are purebreds. Breed&#45;specific rescue groups always have purebred dogs and puppies looking for new homes.</li>
				<li>Most pets end up homeless through no fault of their own&#45;"moving" and "landlord issues" are the top reasons people give for relinquishing their pets, meaning shelters and rescue groups are full of wonderful, family&#45;ready pets.</li>
				<li>Pets adopted from shelters and rescue groups typically cost less than pets purchased or even acquired for free&#45;once you add in the cost of vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, microchip, dewormer, and other "extras" included in your adoption fee, you'll probably be surprised what a bargain an adopted pet really is!</li>
				<li>Most shelters and rescue groups conduct through behavioral analysis of each pet to ensure that they will be the right fit for your family, dramatically improving the chances your new pet will fit right in.</li>
				<li>Shelters and rescue groups can provide advice on making your relationship with your pet the best it can be for the rest of his or her life, so you&#39;ll never have to go it alone!</li>
