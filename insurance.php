				<p>How it Can Help You and Your Pet</p>

				<h4>Pet insurance can help make unexpected vet bills affordable</h4>

				<p>If you're like many pet owners today, you'll do whatever it takes to keep your pet happy and healthy. Our plans help make that possible by offering reimbursement levels of 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%, after a deductible.</p>

				<p>The next time you're faced with an unexpected vet bill, you may not have to worry about borrowing money, using high-interest credit cards or worse, choosing euthanasia because there's no help to pay the bill.</p>

				<h4>Fast reimbursement</h4>

				<p>When your pet needs treatment, you pay your vet directly and then file a claim with us. We process your claims quickly - most within 5 business days. We even offer direct deposit reimbursement so you can focus on the health of your pet instead of worrying about money.</p>
				
				<h4>Smarter than a savings account</h4>
				
				<p>Purchasing a Pets Best Insurance plan can be a great way to ensure you can afford the best veterinary care as soon as your pet needs it - not years from today. If you saved $35 each month, it would take nearly 12 years to save $5,000, the amount our BestBenefit Level 1 plan covers each year.</p>

				<h4>Veterinary costs continue to rise</h4>

				<p>It is widely believed that significant advances in veterinary care have helped to allow pets to live longer lives. Unfortunately, the new diagnosis and treatment options often come at a higher price.</p>

				<h4>Here are a few examples:</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Treating a broken leg can cost: $2,000 - $5,000</li>
				<li>Surgically removing items like rocks or toys can cost: $1,000 - $3,000</li>
				<li>Chronic condition treatment like diabetes or arthritis: $1,000 - $2,500 per year</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Cancer coverage included</h4>

			<p>According to the National Canine Cancer Foundtation, canine cancer affects one out of every three dogs. According to Pets Best Insurance claims data (2005-2012), cancer treatments can cost as much as $10,000 or more. The good news is that all our BestBenefit plans and Cancer Only plans include cancer coverage, so you may not have to cut corners when it comes to your pet's care.</p>

			<h4>Choose the right time to insure your pet</h4>

			<p>We insure dogs and cats 7 weeks and older, and your pet will never outgrow us because we have no upper age limits. We believe senior cats and dogs deserve the same great coverage as puppies and kittens.</p>

			<p>It's important to insure your pet when it's still healthy, because pet insurance plans don't cover pre-existing conditions. Symptoms of some diseases, like kidney failure, take months or years to appear. Insuring your pets at a young age can help guarantee that the majority of your pet's illnesses will be covered.</p>
